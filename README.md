# Short This URL
Basic PHP URL Shortener

# How to use
To open short links, use the url with the "s" parameter with the "code" coresponding to it. For example, https://localhost/index.php?s=hud871893697

To make short links, use the url with the "l" parameter with the link you want. The page will then show a the shorted link. For example, https://localhost/index.php?l=https://example.com

# Installation
Install PHP and enable the SQLite3 extension. Clone the repo, do the configs in the index.php file and you're ready. You can rename the php file too.
